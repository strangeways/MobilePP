Mobile-friendlier Pedalpalooza calendar

The official Pedalpalooza website is at http://www.shift2bikes.org/cal/viewpp2018.php

**Note: Pedalpalooza has a new calendar, so these links no longer show any content.**

Previously, the Pedalpalooza calendar was not very mobile-friendly, so this was an attempt to quickly provide an alternative that loaded and displayed the calendar HTML from the Pedalpalooza site but with custom CSS applied.
